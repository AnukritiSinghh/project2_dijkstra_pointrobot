# Project 2 - ENPM 661 - Planning for Autonomous Robotics

Implementation of the Dijkstra Algorithm for a Point Robot


Required libraries - time, copy, opencv (4 and above), numpy, and heapq


Run code dijkstra_algo.py 


Enter the start position and goal position coordinate values as integers


Output - The final output is the video generated and saved on the system and it prints the total run time
